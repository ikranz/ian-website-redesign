		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I've been around for tewnty something years, and in that time I've picked up a few hobbies. I enjoy going to the movies, fishing, playing board games, and a bunch of other things that would make this list too long.</p>
		<p>I like to learn by doing. This means spending time fixing things that break, trying new activities, and making things (be they creative, practical, or both).</p>
		<p>From August 2015 to May 2019 I attended Cornell University where I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering. I worked hard in my studies, and graduated with a Bachelors of Science. Though I do consider this an achievement, a degree is just a piece of paper. My true takeaways from Cornell are my experiences, be they hours in a lab trying to get my project to work correctly or a Saturday night playing games with friends.</p>
