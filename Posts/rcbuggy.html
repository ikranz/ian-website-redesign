		<h1>RC Buggy</h1>
		<p>Robotics has always been one of my interests. Relating the digital computer hardware to manipulation of the physical world can be very educational and very fun. In the spring of 2017, myself and a classmate built a small robot capable of being remotely controlled by bluetooth. The robot design also enables programmers with less hardware experience to control the robot with a simple python programming interface on a Raspberry Pi.</p>

		<p>Check out some of our code <a href="https://github.com/ikranz/BluetoothRobot" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

		<p>The robot uses a FRDM K64 board for low level control of two servos which control the wheels. The MCU recieves commands from a Raspberry Pi over UART, and the Pi can either be programmed in Python to user specified behavior or controlled by a serial Bluetooth Android application.</p>
