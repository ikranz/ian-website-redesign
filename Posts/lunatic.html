		<h1>Cornell Lunatic Humor Magazine</h1>
		<p>During my time at Cornell, I was a member of the Cornell Lunatic staff. Started in 1978, the Lunatic is a student run magazine that publishes once per semester. Officially, the Lunatic is a humor magazine, but the organization does what it can to stop people at Cornell from taking themselves too seriously, be it through pranks or general mischief. The magazine's content is usually intended to be funny, and some would say it is funny. Others might call it asinine and childish. Regardless, the Lunatic has been around twice as long as its current members have been alive, and with many successful alumni, the Lunatic is a well-established organization. The Lunatic publishes in print and online.</p>
