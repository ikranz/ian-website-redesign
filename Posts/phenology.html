		<h1>Citizen Science Phenology Video</h1>
		<p>During Spring 2019, I produced a video detailing the importance of citizen science efforts in phenology research. Not many people are familiar with phenology or why it's important, so I hope the video can play a part in educating people on relevant issues.</p>
		<p>I worked with a small team to produce the video, so I was also heavily involved in the camera operation, direction, and editing of the video. The video was made possible by the PBS NewsHour Student Reporting Labs as well as WSKG Public Media.</p>
